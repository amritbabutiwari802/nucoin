          NuGenesis is a fully completed native blockchain originally built for
          Government and transnational corporate applications. In the context of
          building a blockchain for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC’s),
          and an exchange clearing house for settlement, limitations to scaling
          and speed, latency and reliance on human miners and validators had to
          be eliminated. Security had to be enhanced, its integrity underscored
          by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and carbon neutral in its efficiency.
